Super-Marvel is an iOS app that uses the Marvel API to display a list of Marvel characters and their details. You can browse through hundreds of heroes and villains from the Marvel universe, see their comics, and learn more about their powers and abilities.
 <br>
 <br>
This app is created as a personal project to showcase my skills and passion for iOS development. This app demonstrates how to implement Clean Architecture and some of the best practices for iOS app development using UIKIt, Combine, MVVM-C, SwiftLint, SwiftGen, and more.

## Setup
1. **Ruby**
   If you use macOS, system Ruby is not recommended. There is a variety of ways to install Ruby without having to modify your system    environment. For macOS and Linux, [**rbenv**](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is one of the most popular ways to manage your Ruby    environment. It's recommended to install [**rbenv**](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) via [**HomeBrew**](https://brew.sh).
 Install Ruby 2.7.6 by running:
    ```shell
       $ rbenv install 2.7.6
    ```
   the app supports Ruby versions 2.7.6 or newer. Verify which Ruby version you're using:
    ```shell
        $ ruby --version
        => ruby 2.7.2p137 (2020-10-01 revision 5445e04352) [x86_64-darwin19]
    ```

3. **Bundler**
   It is recommended that you use [**Bundler**](http://bundler.io) and Gemfile to define the dependency of the app.

    ```shell
       $ gem install bundler
    ```

## Quick start
As this project uses the Marvel API, you need to get your own API keys to run the project. You can
get them by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/) and create an account.
2. Once you have an account, go to the [Get a Key](https://developer.marvel.com/account) page and
   get your public and private keys.
3. Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following lines to
   it:
    ```shell
    MarvelPrivateKey=your_private_key
    MarvelPublicKey=your_public_key
    MarvelHashKey=make_hash_by_MD5
    MarvelTimeStamp=current_time_stamp
    ```
4. Run the following command to generate the [ArkanaKeys](https://github.com/rogerluan/arkana) local
   package that will be used to securely
   fetch your keys in runtime:
    ```shell
    bin/arkana
    ```
